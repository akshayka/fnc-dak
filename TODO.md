## NN Architecture
1. Experiment: add layers
2. Implement and Experiment: Change non-linearities

## Features
1. Implement: Remove stop-words, weight word vectors by TF-IDF
2. Experiment: Dimension of word vectors
3. *** Implement and Experiment: Headline/Body Cosine Similarity Feature
   (append to preds in add_pred_op) ***

## Training word vectors
1. Experiment: do not train word vectors
2. Experiment: train word vectors after N epochs, N a hyperparameter

## Optimization
1. Experiment: tune batch size
2. Implement and Experiment: tune learning rate
3. Implement and Experiment: change optimizer
4. Implement and Experiment: add regularization
5. Experiment: add dropout 

## Evaluation
1. Print training error (after N epochs)

## Debugging
1. Verify that scoring in model.py is correct
