## NN Architecture
1. Experiment: add layers, non-linearities

## Features
1. Remove stop-words, weight word vectors by TF-IDF
2. Experiment: Larger dimensional word vectors.

## Training word vectors
1. Experiment: do not train word vectors
2. Experiment: train word vectors after N epochs, N a hyperparameter

## Optimization
1. Experiment: tune batch size
2. Experiment: tune learning rate
3. Experiment: change optimizer
4. Experiment: add regularization
5. Experiment: add dropout 

## Evaluation
1. Print training error (after N epochs)

## Debugging
